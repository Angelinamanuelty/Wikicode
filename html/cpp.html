        <h2>What is C++?</h2>
        <p style="color: white;">C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. It is widely used for system programming, game development, and applications requiring high-speed processing.</p>

                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p>C++ is known for its support of object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing developers to structure code in terms of objects, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Memory Management</h3>
                <p>C++ provides manual memory management with the use of pointers, allowing fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, a key feature in performance-critical applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature-box">
                <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                <p>C++ is known for its high performance, enabling developers to write software that operates efficiently at both the system and application level, which is critical in resource-constrained environments.</p>
            </div>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of C++</h2>
        <p>C++ was created by <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> in 1979 at Bell Labs. Initially called "C with Classes", it was designed to add object-oriented features to the C programming language, which had become popular for system-level programming.</p>
        <p>Over time, C++ has evolved with various updates, including the introduction of features such as templates, exception handling, and the Standard Template Library (STL), solidifying its place as one of the most widely used programming languages.</p>
        <p>Today, C++ remains crucial in fields such as game development, system programming, real-time applications, and even in modern frameworks and libraries used in industries like finance and aerospace.</p>

        <h2>Uses of C++</h2>
        <p>C++ is used in various domains where high performance, system-level access, and control over hardware are crucial. Some of its most popular uses include:</p>
        <div class="uses-row" id="uses-text">
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>C++ is heavily used in game development, providing low-level access to hardware and memory, essential for creating fast and responsive games. Popular game engines like Unreal Engine use C++.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Systems Programming</h3>
                <p>C++ is widely used for systems programming, including operating systems, device drivers, and embedded systems, due to its ability to provide direct hardware access and its performance advantages.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Real-Time Systems</h3>
                <p>Real-time applications that require predictable and high-performance execution, such as automotive or avionics systems, are often developed using C++.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Financial Systems</h3>
                <p>C++ is frequently used in financial systems and high-frequency trading applications, where performance and low-latency processing are critical.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Scientific Computing</h3>
                <p>C++ is commonly used for scientific computing applications, including simulations and computations that require high precision and speed, such as in physics and engineering fields.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="uses-box">
                <h3>Embedded Systems</h3>
                <p>C++ is a popular choice for programming embedded systems, offering fine control over hardware and efficient memory management, which is necessary for resource-constrained devices.</p>

        <h2>C++ "Hello, World!" Syntax</h2>
        <p>Here's the simplest C++ program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <button class="button" onclick="copyCode()">Copy</button>
            <pre>
<code id="code">#include < iostream >
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
</code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>This line of code prints "Hello, World!" to the console, which is often the first program you write when learning a new language. The <code>cout</code> object is used to output text to the console in C++.</p>
