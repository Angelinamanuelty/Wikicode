    <section id="history">
        <h2>History of Python</h2>
        <p>Python was created by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong>, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. The development of Python started in December 1989, and its implementation was first released in February 1991. Guido van Rossum was inspired by the ABC programming language and sought to create a language that was easy to read and write while being capable of handling complex tasks.</p>
        <p>Since its creation, Python has grown into one of the most popular and widely used programming languages, with a large and active community supporting its development. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, simplicity, and the idea of having one clear way to do things. This has made it a favorite among beginners as well as experienced developers working on diverse projects, from web applications to scientific research.</p>
        <p>Today, Python continues to evolve with a focus on improving performance and adding new features, and it is maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a non-profit organization.</p>

        <h2>Python "Hello, World!" Syntax</h2>
        <p>Here's the simplest Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen:</p>
        <div class="code-box">
            <button class="button" onclick="copyCode()">Copy</button>
            <pre>
<code id="code">print("Hello, World!")</code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>This line of code is the most basic program in Python, and it's commonly used as the first program to learn when starting with a new programming language. The <code>print()</code> function in Python outputs the text inside the parentheses to the console.</p>
